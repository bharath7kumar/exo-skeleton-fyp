DH Parameters of the 4 dof arm

theta - the rotation around z(n-1) to match x(n)
alpha - the rotation around x(n-1) to match z(n)
r     - the distance between the center of frame n and n-1 in x direction
d     - the distance between the center of frame n and n-1 in z direction

where n is the link number
